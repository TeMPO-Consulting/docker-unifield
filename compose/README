In this directory is a prototype of how we can ship
Unifield for Linux using Docker Compose.

The directory unifield needs to be populated with a
copy of Unifield, like this:

	mkdir unifield
	bzr checkout --lightweight lp:unifield-server unifield/server
	bzr checkout --lightweight lp:unifield-web unifield/web

First build uf-base, then let docker-compose take over:

	docker build -f Dockerfile-base -t uf-base .
	docker-compose up -d --build
